# HomePage
Inventory Front End Index page, will be converted into .php page and connected to database for Login page.

#HTML was used for creating the web pages then converted into PHP files, for easier design of the page and since I am using the XAMPP stack and local server. It was easier to not have launch the server 
to view the webpage for every styled container. Once the page was complete file was refactored into .php file extension. 

#Established connection with Database and users are able to login using credentials, and database is also able to currently accept new users from the frontEnd/website. Style for the website is minimal and designed was choosen to be simple using blue and whites as the primary colors.
